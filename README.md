#Description
    Appointment Manager is a webapp built using the Ruby on Rails framework. This system is designed to allow a user(admin) to log in and see all the doctors in their network and also add a new doctor when a new one is hired, and assign appointments to doctors with the associated patients attached.

#Installation Instructions
    If you wish to use this app, you will need to contact me at alyssa.yesilyurt@me.com in order to obtain the correct omniauth information for the app to work properly. If you are not planning to offer third-party login services, this step can be skipped.

    After you fork and clone the repo onto your local computer, make sure you are in the appointment_manager directory and run 'bundle install'.
